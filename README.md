Boot to Yo
==========

OSv is the first operating system to support "boot to Yo" technology, to create a dedicated Yo-sending virtual machine in the cloud. This is a proof of concept.

Run with:

```
capstan build && capstan run -n bridge
```

to experience the fastest "boot to Yo" time and greatest Yo throughput of any operating system.  Because of the rapid boot time of OSv, it is actually possible to boot OSv, then Yo, faster than to Yo alone on a conventional mobile OS.
